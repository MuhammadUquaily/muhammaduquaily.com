  <h2 class="Identity"> Who I am </h2>
  <p class="introduction">I am A 13 Year-Old Irish Pakistani Entrepreneur trying to become succesful at a young age. I have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/muhammaduquaily/" target="_blank">Instagram page</a> and am trying to gain more followers. My passions are Rowing, Football, and Coding. I do boxing and running on the side to keep myself in optimal shape. I am a student in Karachi Grammar School and I represent Streeton House. I am a big fans of people who advocate self-improvement such as Iman Gadzhi, Andrew Tate, and David Goggins. I believe failures are stepping stones to success and no failure will stop me from succeeding. I believe in the power of Allah and whatever he has planned for me will happen. I have an older brother who is 19 and his name is Ali Uquaily, he also has an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aliuquaily/" target="_blank"> Instagram Page </a>. He is the closest person to me ever. He always believes in me and always wants the best for me. I am the youngest of three, having one older brother and one older sister. I always work very hard to try and achieve my gaols but if I fail I dont stop I just let it fuel me more </p>
